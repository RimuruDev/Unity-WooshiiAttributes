## About

<p>
  Originally began due to <a href="https://github.com/dbrizov/NaughtyAttributes">NaughtyAttributes</a> (Should go check them out if you've not already) through learning how to setup attributes in the first place, I continued to add to what myself and teams I worked with needed.
</p>

<p>Overtime, some more specific attributes were required for directly handling arrays, or grouping within the inspector. So this also
  contains a "Global Drawer" core that I use to reorder, assign and find info from classes.
</p>

<p>This will grow as new features and attributes are added to it</p>
